# Installing Data API Service for Dev Usage

This is an old document for setting up the data api service locally, convenient for development and testing of clients. 
> This needs to be updated

## set up a vm

### create vm

```
mkdir service
cd service
vagrant init ubuntu/trusty64
```

### get data_api

```
git clone -b develop https://github.com/eapearson/data_api.git
```

###  edit Vagrantfile and add the networking line

```
config.vm.network "private_network", type: "dhcp"
```

### and enable and edit the virtualbox provider section so that it looks like this:

```
config.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |vb|
     vb.memory = "2048"
end
```    

### Finally, bring up vagrant and go in:

```
vagrant up
vagrant ssh
```

### update vm system

```
sudo su
apt-get update
apt-get upgrade
apt-get dist-upgrade
```

### If anything happened in dist-upgrade, exit, then vagrant reload.

### install system dependencies:

```
apt-get install nginx-extras
apt-get install libfreetype6-dev
apt-get install pkg-config
```

### install thrift

Although the thrift docs give some manual steps for installing thrift, and the Ubuntu distro is a little out of date, the ubuntu distro does work (perhaps a PPA is more up to date.)

```
apt-get install thrift-compiler
```

### install python extra tools:

```
apt-get install python-dev
apt-get install python-setuptools
apt-get install python-pip
pip install --upgrade pip
```

> the latter solves a problem with pandas install

### install python dependencies

```
cd /vagrant/data_api
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- relax, this takes a while, as there are many c binaries to compile and install.
- I could not get numpy to install with python setup.py install, so had to use pip.

###  You can drop out of root now.

### if not using branch with http service, install 

```
lib/doekbase/data_api/tests/taxon_service_http_binary_driver.py
```

from the same named sample file found here.

### generate python thrift pieces and install in the proper location.

```
mkdir temp
thrift --gen py:new_style -out temp thrift/specs/taxonomy/taxon/taxon.thrift
cp -pr temp/taxon/* lib/doekbase/data_api/taxonomy/taxon/service
```

Thrift will install the generated files in ```taxon``` into whichever "out" directory you specify. However, data_api expects it to be in ```lib/doekbase/data_api/taxonomy/taxon/service```.

Therefore we can't just generate the files and point them to the correct location. So we generate them in a temp location and then copy them.

### regenerate the egg

```
sudo python setup.py install
```

### set up nginx

edit the default config

```
sudo vi /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
```

- replace the content with the sample "nginx_config.conf" file found here
- this sets up CORS and the reverse proxy.
- restart nginx

```
sudo service nginx restart
```

start the thrift service

```
python lib/doekbase/data_api/tests/taxon_service_http_binary_driver.py
```

map ```euk.kbase.us``` to the server

on your local dev host, you'll need to map the euk.kbase.us (or whatever 
host name you want to use) host to the IP of the VM:

in the vm issue
    
```
ifconfig
```

note the ipaddress for eth1.

in the local dev host (mac) edit the hosts file

```
sudo vi /etc/hosts
```

at the end of the file place

```
IP euk.kbase.us
```

    where IP is the ip address you noted above.

## TODO

- use nginx extra headers to allow CORS to work with 502s - DONE
- startup binary over http service


## FIN
